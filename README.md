## What is Keylogger?
Keylogger is a type of hacker software tool which could record keystrokes made by a user. Usually, the hacker implements the keyboard monitoring by using the Trojan program. The software keylogger is a computer program designed to record any input from the keyboard. Also, the keyloggers target the programs installed on a computer, smartphone, and electronic devices that require a password. 

Typically, a keylogger consists of three main parts: Control program: Used to monitor activity, adjust settings, and view the keylogger's log files. This part is the most hidden part of the keylogger and is usually only accessible via special shortcut key combinations. Hook files, or watchdog Log files for logging keystrokes, taking screenshots (this is the most important part), can log all stored/recorded hooks. Also, depending on the type, there may be additional guards (guard program), notifiers (report program). 

## How it does it
In systems, when a key on the keyboard is pressed, the keyboard converts it into a signal and transmits it to the CPU. The CPU passes it to the operating system for the operating system to translate into letters or numbers for use by itself or other programs. But when there is a keylogger in that system, not only the OS is monitored, but also the hook file/monitor that the keylogger monitors records and translates the signals written to the log file. It can also track screen and mouse movements.

## The users
The hacker would want to use it to steal peopleâ€™s password, or their private data. For example, when a user types in his online banking username and password, the hacker could copy that and transfer his money. However, the keylogger can help the clerk to record which websites have been visited and the applications (and some other activities) used by users of that computer. Also, parents can know what their kids are doing with the computer.
